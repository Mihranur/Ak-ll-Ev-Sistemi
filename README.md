# 🏠 Smart Home System with Cisco Devices

This project is a **Smart Home System** simulation developed using Cisco devices.  
The aim is to securely manage IoT devices over a centralized network and demonstrate basic network security measures.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco Router and Server Configuration  
- IoT Devices (smart light, window, door, etc.)  
- Network Security: SSID hiding, MAC filtering, WPA2-PSK encryption  

## 🔐 Security Measures

To protect the home network from unauthorized access, the following security techniques have been implemented:

- **SSID Broadcasting Disabled:** The wireless network name is hidden to reduce unauthorized connection attempts.  
- **MAC Address Filtering:** Only predefined devices are allowed to connect to the network.  
- **WPA2-PSK Encryption:** Strong encryption is used to secure wireless data transmission.

## 🌐 System Features

- IoT devices are managed through a central server.  
- All devices access the internet via the router under defined rules.  
- Wireless access point is configured via a Cisco wireless router.  
- All network traffic is designed to be monitorable and controllable through security filters.

## 📌 Notes

This project demonstrates how a basic smart home system can be built using Cisco equipment and how essential security measures can be applied.  
It is suitable for use in educational and laboratory environments.
